# JavaCrashCourse

Just open JavaCrashCourse.md file in any markdown editor (github works as well).
There is also helper functionality of quickly running code snippets implemented in `runSnippetFromKeyboardShortcut` directory. To use it you have to:
- have JDK installed with `java` and `javac` added to PATH
- download autohotkey from https://www.autohotkey.com/
Autohotkey makes it possible to compile and run java:
- without arguments with `ctrl+shift+j` shortcut
- with arguments with `ctrl+shift+i` shortcut
You can change shortcuts by editing `.ahk` text files.
